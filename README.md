# NYSL-app
CHALLENGE: Create an app for the Northside Youth Soccer League (NYSL), 
to give their players and parents easy on-the-go access to the league's game schedules. 
To avoid the hassles of native apps, they would like this to be a mobile web app. 
Design and develop the mobile web app, and add features to the app that are specific to mobile devices, 
such as location-based features so parents can see where they are in relation to the soccer field.The design and development of a single-page mobile web app - looks and feels like a native mobile application.
I've been using Firebase for deployment, authenticating login and as a database to be able to post and read messages as a user.

PROCESS: 
• Using new features in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to make the mobile web app look and feel like a native mobile application.
• Using Firebase for deployment, authenticating login and as a database to be able to post and read messages as a user.
• Taking advantage of specific capabilities of smartphones such as location-awareness.

WHAT I LIKED MOST: 
• That I was now able to build the app that I was designing first and bringing it to life.
• I found out I love the framework Vue and it excites me there's much more I want to explore there.
